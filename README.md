 # Smart Waste Management  

## Overview  
This project is a **Smart Waste Segregation System** integrating **AI-based waste classification**, **IoT-enabled self-sorting bins**, **real-time waste tracking**, and **a reward system** to encourage responsible waste disposal. The system consists of:  
- **AI-powered waste classification** using a deep learning model  
- **ESP32-controlled smart bin** for automatic waste sorting  
- **Web & Mobile Dashboard** for tracking deposits and rewards  
- **Gamified reward system** based on segregated waste  
- **Real-time bin status monitoring**
